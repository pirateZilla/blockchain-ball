This is a tool for office betting pools for the World Cup for 2018.

## Current Configuration
The initial configuration was for 16 people to be given 2 teams each from this year's participants in the Fifa World Cup. The 32 teams are divided into 4 groups based on their world rankings; rank 1 being the strongest team and rank 4 being the weakest. In the interest of fairness, team combinations must involve either a team from both rank 1 and 4, or rank 2 and 3.
